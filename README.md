📊 Sports Performance Data Analysis

A data analytics project exploring striker performance using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib to uncover patterns in scoring efficiency, accuracy, and match performance.

✅ Project Overview

This project analyzes a striker performance dataset to understand:

Goal-scoring patterns

Shot accuracy and conversion

Match-wise contribution

Factors that correlate with strong performance

It includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical summaries, and visual insights.

✅ Objectives

Identify missing or inconsistent data

Clean & preprocess the dataset

Perform EDA to understand striker performance

Visualize scoring trends and key metrics

Extract insights useful for sports analysts & coaches

🛠️ Tech Stack

✅ Key Steps Performed
1. Data Loading

Imported the striker dataset using Pandas

Checked dataset shape, column names, and basic info

2. Data Cleaning

Identified missing values

Handled nulls and inconsistencies

Standardized numeric columns

Removed duplicates

3. Exploratory Data Analysis

Performed EDA on major performance metrics:

Goals scored

Total shots

Shot accuracy

Match appearances

Passing and assist contributions

4. Visualizations

Created charts such as:

Goals distribution

Correlation heatmap

Accuracy vs. Goals scatter plot

Player performance comparisons

✅ Insights Extracted

Identified top-performing strikers

Found correlation between shot attempts and goals

Highlighted players with high accuracy but fewer goals (under-utilized talent)

Spotted outliers in performance metrics

✅ Conclusion

This project demonstrates:

Good understanding of EDA

Ability to work with real datasets

Skill in extracting actionable insights

Data cleaning + visualization capabilities

It is suitable for Data Analyst, Business Analyst, and Sports Analytics roles.
